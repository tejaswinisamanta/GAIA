# Problem
How might we develop solutions to minimize the environmental impacts identified from Al usage?

# Problem Statement
The increasing AI prompt traffic makes it difficult for AI developers to maintain the AI system performance. Optimizing code for prompt traffic requires excessive computational power, leading to consuming large amounts of electricity and energy inefficiently.

# Our Proposed Solution
Our solution is a server manager, a middleman app between server providers and our clients - small and medium businesses - which would allow for a better sharing of server resources and also help limit the energy usage of the servers by scheduling them to turn on and off using an AI but also to divide server usage between different clients while assuring privacy, cost minimisation, and energy efficiency.

# Role of AI in our Solution
AI will be used to manage connections between people to allocate tasks. Scheduling will enhance user sessions. AI would be able to shut down servers on demand, and divide the power used between the users for balanced processing power.

# Backend
Python + PyTorch + library : PSutil + matplotlib. 
# Frontend
Figma ( future : React, Django, HTML and CSS + Javascript)
